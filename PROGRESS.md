## üêõ Errors Encountered & Fixes Applied

### Design Evolution Issues
| Error | Description | Solution Applied |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **Color Palette Rejection** | Initial teal/purple colors deemed unprofessional | Switched to electric blue/white lightning theme |
| **Hover Effects Dislike** | User didn't like shimmer buttons and hover reveals | Replaced with permanent visible gradient buttons |
| **Neural Network Over-sparkling** | Lightning effects too intense and distracting | Reduced energy thresholds and glow intensity |
| **Design Blandness** | Initial design lacked boldness and impact | Increased typography sizes and strengthened contrasts |

### Technical Implementation Fixes
| Error | Description | Solution Applied |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **Docker Status Server** | Container running status page instead of Next.js | Modified Dockerfile.dev CMD to run actual dev server |
| **Lightning Icon Import** | `Lightning` not exported from lucide-react | Changed import to `Zap as Lightning` |
| **String Match Errors** | MultiEdit operations failing on exact strings | Used Read tool first for exact string matching |
| **Neural Network Interface** | TypeScript errors on energy properties | Added energy and lightningCharge to Node interface |

### User Feedback Integration
| Feedback | User Request | Implementation |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Background Colors** | "Very ugly", wanted professional colors | Redesigned with electric blue/white palette |
| **Permanent Button Colors** | Disliked hover-only visibility | Created permanently visible gradient buttons |
| **Sparkling Intensity** | "Neuronetwork is sparkling too much" | Reduced lightning frequency and energy thresholds |
| **Design Boldness** | "Make it more bold" | Increased font sizes to font-black and text-8xl |
| **Movement Enhancement** | "Should be moving a bit more" | Increased node velocity while controlling sparkling |
