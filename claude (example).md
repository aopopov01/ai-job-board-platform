## Core Architecture Principles

## Development Workflow

### 1. File Operations
- **Always use absolute paths**: Start with `/Users/michael.gitsis/testMG/TBD/`
- **Use Desktop Commander tools** for file operations (read_file, write_file, list_directory)
- **Follow chunking strategy**: Write files in 25-30 line chunks using write_file with mode 'rewrite' then 'append'

### 2. Task Management
- **NOTE**: We do NOT use Taskmaster for this project
- **Follow task breakdown structure** defined in TASK_BREAKDOWN.md
- **Update task status** manually in TASK_BREAKDOWN.md after completing each sub-task
- **Track progress** through the comprehensive task list and dependencies

### 3. Git Operations
- **Use GitHub MCP** for repository operations
- **Push to git after each completed sub-task**
- **Test functionality before committing**
- **Read and act on CodeRabbit comments**

#### Git Commit Best Practices
- **Email for commits**: gitsis.michael@gmail.com
- **Concise, descriptive messages** (50 chars or less for title)
- **Only push the actual files**, not paste code in commit messages
- **Reference what changed**, not show the entire code

### 4. Database Operations
- **Use Supabase MCP** for database operations
- **Apply migrations** for DDL changes using apply_migration
- **Use execute_sql** for queries and data operations
- **Follow RLS policies** for multi-tenant security

### 5. Documentation & Research
- **Use available MCPs** for enhanced functionality (see MCP list below)
- **Research thoroughly** before implementing new features
- **Document findings** and integrate with project knowledge

## Project Status & Next Steps

### Documentation Complete ‚úÖ

### Completed Tasks ‚úÖ

### Next Tasks


**IMPORTANT**: Always refer to **TASK_BREAKDOWN.md** for the next tasks and detailed requirements.

### Key Features Designed

## Critical Development Workflow

### **MANDATORY Sub-Task Completion Process**
Before moving to ANY next task, you MUST complete this exact sequence:

1. **‚úÖ Build Verification**
   - Run `npm run build` and ensure NO errors
   - Fix any TypeScript compilation errors
   - Resolve any linting issues with `npm run lint`

2. **üß™ Comprehensive Testing**
   - **Backend Testing**: Test all API endpoints using available MCPs
   - **Frontend Testing**: Test UI functionality thoroughly
   - **Database Testing**: Verify all database operations work correctly
   - **Integration Testing**: Test end-to-end functionality
   - **Use MCPs** for automated testing where possible

3. **üì§ Git Synchronization**
   - **ONLY** if build and tests are successful:
   - Commit changes with descriptive messages
   - Push to git repository using email: gitsis.michael@gmail.com
   - Sync with remote repository

4. **üìã Task Progress Update**
   - Update task status in TASK_BREAKDOWN.md
   - Mark completed sub-tasks as done
   - Move to next task ONLY after full completion

4. **üê≥ Docker Environment**
   - Ensure all services are running properly
   - Rebuild containers if dependencies changed
   - Verify application runs correctly on port TBD

### **Task Navigation**
- **Always check TASK_BREAKDOWN.md** for next tasks
- Follow the exact task order and dependencies
- Never skip the verification process above

## Key Reminders for Claude
1. **Project is starting from scratch** - no code has been written yet
2. **ALWAYS follow the mandatory completion process** above for every sub-task
3. **Never move to next task** until build, tests, and git sync are successful
4. **Follow component reusability patterns** 
5. **Maintain consistent code style** with project specifications
6. **Use absolute paths** for all file operations
7. **Implement proper error handling** and user feedback
8. **Consider mobile responsiveness** in all UI implementations
9. **Follow security best practices** for data access
10. **Apply coding guidelines** to prevent common TypeScript and ESLint errors
11. **Document insights and solutions**: When discovering important bug fixes, workarounds, or technical solutions during development, **immediately update this claude.md file** with the new knowledge to prevent duplicated effort in future development cycles
12. **Self-Learning Protocol**: After resolving any significant error or discovering a pattern:
    - Document the problem and solution in this file under "Common Issues and Prevention Guidelines"
    - Include specific error messages, root causes, and solutions
    - Add preventive measures to avoid similar issues in the future
    - This ensures continuous improvement and knowledge retention across sessions
