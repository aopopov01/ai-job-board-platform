# TalentAIze Platform Security Checklist ‚ö°

## üö® Immediate Actions Required

### 1. **Fix Supabase RLS Vulnerability** (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Execute `SUPABASE-SECURITY-FIX.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Verify RLS is enabled on `job_categories` table
- [ ] Test with verification queries provided
- [ ] Monitor Supabase security dashboard for alerts


## üõ°Ô∏è Comprehensive Security Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Security (Execute Today)
- [ ] Run `SUPABASE-SECURITY-FIX.sql` - Fixes immediate RLS issues
- [ ] Test all RLS policies with different user roles
- [ ] Verify public data access still works correctly
- [ ] Check admin-only functions are properly restricted

### Phase 2: Advanced Monitoring (Execute This Week)
- [ ] Run `SECURITY-MONITORING.sql` - Implements advanced security features
- [ ] Set up rate limiting for API endpoints
- [ ] Configure suspicious activity detection
- [ ] Test security event logging

### Phase 3: Ongoing Security (Ongoing)
- [ ] Daily security report reviews
- [ ] Regular security event cleanup
- [ ] Monitor rate limiting effectiveness
- [ ] Update security policies as needed

## üîç Security Verification Tests

### Test 1: RLS Functionality
```sql
-- Test as anonymous user (should work)
SELECT * FROM public.job_categories LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM public.jobs WHERE status = 'active' LIMIT 5;

-- Test as anonymous user (should fail)
SELECT * FROM public.user_profiles LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM public.applications LIMIT 5;
```

### Test 2: User Data Isolation
```sql
-- As authenticated user, should only see own data
SELECT * FROM public.applications WHERE candidate_id = auth.uid();
SELECT * FROM public.user_profiles WHERE id = auth.uid();
```

### Test 3: Company Data Access
```sql
-- As company user, should only see own jobs and applications
SELECT * FROM public.jobs WHERE company_id = auth.uid();
SELECT * FROM public.applications a 
JOIN public.jobs j ON a.job_id = j.id 
WHERE j.company_id = auth.uid();
```

## üìä Security Monitoring Dashboard

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- [ ] Failed login attempts per hour
- [ ] Rate limit violations
- [ ] Suspicious activity alerts
- [ ] Database query patterns
- [ ] API endpoint usage

### Daily Security Tasks
- [ ] Review security events from past 24 hours
- [ ] Check for unusual IP address patterns
- [ ] Monitor application submission rates
- [ ] Verify backup and audit log integrity

### Weekly Security Tasks
- [ ] Generate comprehensive security report
- [ ] Review and update RLS policies if needed
- [ ] Clean up old security events (keep 90 days)
- [ ] Test security incident response procedures

## üöÄ Platform Security Features

### ‚úÖ Implemented Security Measures
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Enabled on all core tables
