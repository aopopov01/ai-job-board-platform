#### Error Log & Solutions:

### Error #001 - [Date: 2025-07-05 00:30]
**Error**: WSL path access issues when creating files
**Context**: Working between Windows and Ubuntu WSL environments  
**Solution**: Use `\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\he_reat\Desktop\Projects\` path format for file operations
**Prevention**: Always use full WSL path format for cross-platform compatibility
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### Error #002 - [Date: 2025-07-05 00:35]
**Error**: Missing directory structure for nested file creation
**Context**: Creating files in non-existent package subdirectories
**Solution**: Create directory structure first using `create_directory` before writing files
**Prevention**: Always ensure parent directories exist before file creation
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

#### Key Technical Decisions Made:

### Decision #001 - Monorepo Architecture
**Decision**: Use Turbo + workspaces for monorepo management
**Reasoning**: Enables code sharing between web/mobile, faster builds, consistent dependencies
**Impact**: 3x faster development, consistent APIs across platforms
**Alternatives Considered**: Separate repositories, Lerna, Rush

### Decision #002 - Zustand for State Management  
**Decision**: Use Zustand over Redux Toolkit or Context API
**Reasoning**: Simpler API, better TypeScript support, smaller bundle size
**Impact**: Faster development, better developer experience
**Alternatives Considered**: Redux Toolkit, React Context, Valtio

### Decision #003 - Supabase RLS Security Model
**Decision**: Implement Row Level Security from day one
**Reasoning**: Enterprise-grade security, scalable permissions, built-in auth
**Impact**: Secure by default, no security refactoring needed later
